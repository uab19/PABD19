                        <p>The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: [ˈʃɛːfɐˌhʊnt]) is a
                            breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. In the English
                            language,
                            the breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog (sometimes abbreviated as
                            GSD).
                            The breed was officially known as the Alsatian in Britain until 1977 when its name was
                            changed
                            back to German Shepherd.[citation needed] </p>
                        <p> Despite its primitive, wolf-like appearance the German
                            Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the
                            Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep.
                            Since
                            that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience,
                            German
                            Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including
                            disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and acting.[5] The
                            German
                            Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club[6] and seventh-most
                            registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.[7]</p>
